    Formal Philosophy is an opinionated tutorial project about the philosophy of formal
    methods. The goal is not to replace textbooks. The goal is to make the core ideas
    usable in your head, so that tools feel like extensions of thinking rather than magic.
  </p>

  <h2>What you will find here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Concrete metaphors that remain formally accurate</li>
    <li>State machines, invariants, and counterexamples explained as mental moves</li>
    <li>Practical boundaries: what is provable, what is testable, and what is merely plausible</li>
  </ul>

    If you spot an ambiguity, a misleading mental frame, or a missing assumption, open an
    issue or a pull request. Clear writing is part of the spec.
